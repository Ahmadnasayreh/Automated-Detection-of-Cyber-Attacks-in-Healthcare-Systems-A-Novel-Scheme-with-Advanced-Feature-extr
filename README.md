Data Transformation and Feature Selection: Utilized power transformation to normalize data and applied PCA iteratively to select optimal features by removing the least useful ones.
Integrated Model Development: Proposed a new approach combining LSTM for efficient feature extraction with KNN for classification.
High Accuracy Achievement: Achieved the highest accuracy across four comprehensive IoMT datasets, outperforming previous research on these datasets.
